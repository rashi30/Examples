    <p align="justify" id="p">  Now that you’ve seen the basics of how HTML works, you should know how the web has
evolved to its current state. As a web designer, you will encounter all types of HTML coding
practices in the real world. Understanding the evolution of HTML will help you recognize
various web design methods. You may encounter sites that completely comply with current
standards, ones that still use design trends and code from years ago, and others that mix
coding styles in improbable ways. Many sites still use table-based designs, which are outmoded
and now rendered obsolete by CSS. Web design tools can create all different kinds
of code. Proprietary software implementations manipulate code to get the exact result they
want. Although it is easy to say that everyone should use web standards, to be a successful
web designer you need to understand the past, present, and future directions of HTML,
coding standards, and common practices, many of which may not match the standards you
learn about in this book.
When Tim Berners-Lee first proposed HTML at the European Laboratory for Particle Physics
(CERN) in , he was looking for a way to easily manage and share information among
scientific colleagues over the Internet. Until this time, the complexity of using the Internet
for exchanging messages and sharing files limited its use to groups of specialists in defense,
academia, and science.
Berners-Lee joined the ideas of a simple tool for reading the documents (the browser),
rules for creating a document markup language (HTML), and a communications protocol
that allowed hypertext linking through Uniform Resource Locators (URLs). This accessible,
simple interface made using the Internet available to the public. Not only could people read
documents, they could easily create them using the easy-to-understand HTML.
As Berners-Lee developed the idea of a web of documents connected by hypertext links
and hosted by computers called hypertext servers, he created a simplified application of
the Standard Generalized Markup Language (SGML), a standard system for specifying
document structure, which he called the Hypertext Markup Language. HTML significantly
reduces the complexity of using SGML to facilitate transmission of documents over the
Internet.
When Berners-Lee created HTML, he adopted only the elements of SGML necessary for
representing basic office documents such as memos and reports. The first version of HTML
included roughly elements that represented basic document structure such as titles,
headings, paragraphs, and lists. HTML was originally intended for simple document structure,
not for handling today’s varied and complex information needs.</p>
